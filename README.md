This is my project for Final test at dibimbing,
I work with real data from yahoo finance
The goal is to get as accurate prediction as possible so that i can get used in the real stocks environment

some difficulities that i still need to solve is that :
1. The accuracy still low
2. to counter point 1, i set the threshold to 0.6 , so that it will predict less often but with more clarity but that becone a problem because is the predictioons comes rarely
3. I need to add some sentiment analysis on this

Maybe i will do it in phase 2 , I hope i got time and capabilities to do it in the future
wish me luck :)
